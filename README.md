## Critical Importance of Google doc-style Commenting Plugin

Did you know that 35% of the web uses, WordPress from stand-alone blog posts to content-intensive news sites and more? But, publishing content on WordPress is not a simple task. One needs to create content, then get suggestions from all stakeholders, and then implement these. But it is not over yet. In most cases, stakeholders will take one final look at the content, again place comments where required, and ask content creators to make the necessary changes. **Typically, this review/validation process becomes even more time consuming because it does not happen consistently.**

Imagine that you are creating a post, which you have published as a draft. During the review process, the stakeholder will review and, more often than not, suggest changes via a Word/Google doc. The content creator will review the comments, makes the required changes, and inform the stakeholder to review the updates. If needed, more revisions are sought, using the same process.

But not anymore! **WordPress Google Doc-Style Gutenberg Block Commenting Plugin is built to streamline the commenting process in a Google-doc style, wherein feedback/suggestion comments can be placed from within the WordPress platform, by choosing the specific content areas, where changes need to be made.**

Multidots recognized the need for a plugin that eases the commenting process. We created a plugin solution that leverages the features of the native Gutenberg editor within WordPress to place comments. This plugin allows clients or key stakeholders to comment directly on the specific text in the Gutenberg blocks. This is a beta version, and we have made it publicly available to the WordPress community. While we have done all the research and identified specific needs that this plugin will address, we believe the community’s participation will further enhance the comments plugin features.

## Future Roadmap

The next release of this Google Docs-style Gutenberg block commenting plugin will be a more optimized version with far more enhanced commenting features. These will be as follows:

### 1 Markup features along with the comments.

This feature will allow users to add suggestions for adding/removing certain text on a specific location. These suggestions can be placed in a popup allowing other users to see these suggestions.

### 2. Asynchronous comments

WordPress is offering a collaborative editing experience through Google Docs so that different users are able to edit the same content of a page/post simultaneously. To keep in step with this WordPress development, we are also planning an update wherein different users can add comments on a particular Gutenberg content block at the same time through the Content Editor.

We hope the “Commenting” feature will help manage editorial flow within Gutenberg blocks. We appreciate bug reports and any other contributions that can enhance the value of this Gutenberg Google Docs-style commenting plugin. Please refer to this guide for more information about how to get involved.
